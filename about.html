					<h1>About</h1>
					<h6>Myself</h6>
				</div>
				<p>My name is<em> Rosie Emma Louise Frankland</em>, I did <strong>taste</strong> art since early childhood when I started to imagine and draw the bedtime stories told by my parents and grandparents. At the beginning I have started small, on scrap paper, then in one day, exhausting all the pages, I was looking at the walls in my room, then with a smile and <strong>exploratory </strong>heart I dared to expand my visions on those 4 immaculate “canvases” . I have created my own virtual world, timeless, with my heroes, unseen creatures and <strong>surreal</strong>, all imagined, deformed and transformed by my own understanding and imagination ... I have been in <strong>love</strong> with drawing ever since, as it offered me inner peace, smiles and <strong>serenity</strong>, things that the majority of us are craving. </p>

				<h6>Temporary tattoos</h6></div>
			<hr>
			<p>The temporary tattoos last about as long as the layer of skin you’ve applied them to. That is usually between 1 and 2 weeks, depending on a variety of factors. In the meantime, you will find that our temporary tattoos are remarkably resistant to soap and water. But NEVER APPLY SUN SCREEN over temporary tattoos as they will quickly fall off.
				<br>
				Start with clean, dry skin. Temporary tattoos are made with water-based ink, which means that they’re repelled by skin’s natural oils. Carefully clean the area you want to decorate with soap and water, and pat it dry with a paper towel.
				<br>
				If you’re very sweaty, rubbing alcohol can help cut the grease. Pour a little onto a cotton ball, and then wipe it on the area. Don’t do this every day, though--you could dry out your skin
				.Place the image face down on your skin. Confirm that you want to apply the tattoo to the spot you just cleaned, then place the face side against your skin. Don’t wiggle it around. Just hold it firmly in place while you move on to the next step.
				<br>
				Press a damp cloth or sponge over the tattoo paper. Take a piece of fabric or a sponge that is neither bone dry nor soaking wet, and push it firmly against the backing of your tattoo. Hold it in place, and don’t let it slip around, even if it wants to.<br>
				Hold for at least 60 seconds. To get the most complete image, you’ll need a bit of patience. Don’t even think about removing the cloth or the paper backing from your arm until a full minute has passed. While you’re sitting, try to move as little as possible. Gently peel off the paper.
				Start by lifting a single corner of the backing in order to peek at the tattoo. If the image looks weird, or isn't sticking to your skin, put the cloth or sponge back on and wait for another 30 seconds. If it does look good, then continue to slowly peel off the paper.<br>
				Wait for the tattoo to dry. Keep being patient for around ten minutes. Resist the urge to poke your temporary tattoo. It’s best to sit reasonably still and not flex too much, to avoid wrinkling or smearing the tattoo, as well.
				Dab on a bit of water-based lotion. To make your tattoo last even longer, hydrate your skin by gently patting a bit of thin cream or lotion on top. Avoid thick, oil-based moisturizers, like petroleum jelly, which may smear the tattoo. If you want, you can dust baby powder over the top of the tattoo as well, to make it look more matte (and thus more realistic.)
